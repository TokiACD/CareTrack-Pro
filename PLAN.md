## ⚠️ **RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION**

### **🔴 HIGHEST RISK AREAS**

#### **1. Progress Card Complexity** 
**Risk Level: Very High | Impact: Critical | Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
- **Challenges**: 
  - Complex assessment workflow with 4 sections
  - Competency management with manual overrides
  - PDF generation with comprehensive data
  - Notification system integration
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Break into smaller components (progress view, assessment flow, competency management)
  - Build assessment workflow incrementally
  - Start with basic PDF, enhance formatting later

#### **2. Rota Card Scheduling Rules** 
**Risk Level: Very High | Impact: Critical | Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
- **Challenges**: 
  - 8 complex interdependent scheduling rules
  - Real-time validation with clear error messaging
  - Drag-and-drop interface complexity
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implement rules one at a time with comprehensive testing
  - Create separate rule validation engine
  - Build simple calendar first, add drag-and-drop later

### **🟡 MEDIUM RISK AREAS**

#### **3. Carer App Integration**
**Risk Level: Medium | Impact: Medium**
- **Challenge**: Notification system to external carer app
- **Mitigation**: Design API-first approach, implement notifications later if needed

#### **4. Real-time Performance**
**Risk Level: Medium | Impact: Medium**
- **Challenge**: Complex progress calculations across multiple entities
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching strategy early, optimize queries
