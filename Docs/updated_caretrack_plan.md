## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design (12 Core Entities)

### Primary Entities
- **AdminUsers** - Email invite system, soft delete with timestamps
- **Carers** - User management, competency tracking, soft delete cascade rules
- **CarePackages** - Name + 3-digit postcode, soft delete with dependency checking
- **Tasks** - Target completion counts, soft delete with reference validation
- **Assessments** - 4-section structure (Knowledge, Practical, Emergency, Tasks)
- **CompetencyRatings** - Assessment outcomes + manual overrides with timestamps
- **Shifts** - Regular and competent-only shifts with cancellation handling
- **RotaEntries** - Calendar scheduling with complex rule validation
- **AuditLogs** - Comprehensive system activity tracking

### Relationship Tables
- **CarerPackageAssignments** - Many-to-many with historical progress preservation
- **PackageTaskAssignments** - Many-to-many with reference tracking
- **AssessmentResponses** - Assessment answers storage with versioning

   - Error handling for incomplete assessments
   - Mobile-friendly form layouts

### Phase 3: Advanced Dashboard Cards 6-8
6. **Progress Card - Enhanced**
   - **Progress Tracking**: Cached calculations with smart updates
   - **PDF Generation**: Client-side PDF download to admin PC using jsPDF/Puppeteer
   - **Competency System**: Timestamp-based rating hierarchy
     - Manual overrides take precedence (with admin name + timestamp)
     - Assessment results with date tracking
     - Clear display: "Competent (Manual - Set by Admin Smith on 12/01/25)"
   - **Historical Data**: Preserve progress when assignments change
   - **Loading States**: Progress bar calculations with skeleton loaders

7. **Shift Sender Card**
   - Competency-based filtering with loading indicators
   - Error handling for unavailable carers
   - Shift cancellation for soft-deleted carers
   - Mobile-responsive carer selection

8. **Rota Card - Advanced**
   - **Drag-and-drop calendar** with rule validation
   - **Real-time rule checking** with clear error explanations:
     - "Cannot schedule: This carer needs 2 days rest between night and day shifts"
     - "Rule violation: No competent staff member scheduled for this shift"
   - **Scheduling Rules Validation**:
     - 1 competent staff member minimum
     - 36-hour weekly limits with running totals
     - Rotation pattern enforcement
     - Rest period calculations
   - **Error Display**: Visual indicators with detailed explanations
   - **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly drag operations

### Phase 4: System Management Cards 9-10
9. **Recycle Bin Card - Enhanced**
   - **Dependency Checking**: Show references before permanent deletion
   - **Cascade Rules**: 
     - Soft-deleted carers: Cancel future shifts, mark current as "needs replacement"
     - Require conflict resolution before restore
   - **30-day Cleanup**: Automated with dependency validation
   - **Warning System**: "This task is referenced in 5 assessments"

10. **Audit Login Card**
    - Comprehensive activity logging
    - Real-time updates with WebSocket connections
    - Advanced filtering with search performance optimization
    - Export functionality for compliance

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Optimization

- **Production Deployment**: Render deployment with monitoring

## üîß Enhanced Technical Solutions

### Data Integrity & Edge Cases
**Soft Delete Cascade Rules**:
```typescript
// When carer is soft-deleted:
1. Cancel future shifts (with admin notification)
2. Mark current shifts as "requires replacement"
3. Block restore until shift conflicts resolved
4. Show warning: "This carer has 3 upcoming shifts"
```

**Competency Rating Conflicts**:
```typescript
// Timestamp-based priority system
Rating hierarchy (most recent wins):
1. Manual override (always precedence + timestamp)
2. Assessment result
3. Previous manual rating
4. Default: Not Assessed
```

**Assignment Change Handling**:
```typescript
// Preserve historical progress
When assignment changes:
1. Keep existing progress data (don't delete)
2. Show: "Previous Package: 85% complete"
3. Start fresh progress for new package
4. Allow admin to transfer relevant progress
```

### Performance & Scalability
**System Capacity Planning**:
- **Initial Targets**: 500 carers, 50 care packages, 100 tasks, 10 concurrent admins
- **Progress Calculation**: Cached results with smart invalidation
- **PDF Generation**: Client-side generation for immediate download
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and connection pooling

**PDF Generation Strategy**:
```typescript
// Client-side PDF generation
1. Use jsPDF or react-pdf for browser generation
2. Generate and download immediately to admin PC
3. No server storage needed
4. Include: carer details, progress bars, assessment answers, competency ratings, assessor details
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
**Rule Violation Handling**:
- Clear, specific error messages with remediation steps
- Real-time validation during data entry
- Visual indicators for constraint violations
- Bulk operation error aggregation

**Loading States**:
- Skeleton loaders for complex calculations
- Progress indicators for PDF generation
- Debounced search with loading states
- Connection status indicators

### Mobile Responsiveness
**Mobile-First Design**:
- Responsive breakpoints using Material-UI system
- Touch-friendly drag operations for rota
- Collapsible card layouts for mobile
- Optimized forms for mobile input

## üìä Success Metrics & Monitoring
- **Functionality**: All 10 dashboard cards fully operational
