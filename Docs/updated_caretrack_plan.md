## üîß Enhanced Technical Solutions

### Data Integrity & Edge Cases

**Soft Delete Cascade Rules:**
```typescript
// When carer is soft-deleted:
1. Cancel future shifts (with admin notification)
2. Mark current shifts as "requires replacement"
3. Block restore until shift conflicts resolved
4. Show warning: "This carer has 3 upcoming shifts"
```

**Competency Rating Priority System:**
```typescript
// Timestamp-based priority system
Rating hierarchy (most recent wins):
1. Manual override (always precedence + timestamp)
2. Assessment result (with completion date)
3. Previous manual rating
4. Default: Not Assessed
```

**Assignment Change Handling:**
```typescript
// Preserve historical progress
When assignment changes:
1. Keep existing progress data (don't delete)
2. Show: "Previous Package: 85% complete"
3. Start fresh progress for new package
4. Allow admin to transfer relevant progress if needed
```

### Performance & Scalability

**System Capacity Planning:**
- **Initial Targets**: 500 carers, 50 care packages, 100 tasks, 10 concurrent admins
- **Progress Calculation**: Cached results with smart invalidation
- **PDF Generation**: Client-side generation for immediate download
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and connection pooling

**PDF Generation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Client-side PDF generation
1. Use jsPDF or react-pdf for browser generation
2. Generate and download immediately to admin PC
3. No server storage needed
4. Include: carer details, progress bars, assessment answers, competency ratings, assessor details
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

**Rule Violation Handling:**
- Clear, specific error messages with remediation steps
- Real-time validation during data entry
- Visual indicators for constraint violations
- Bulk operation error aggregation
